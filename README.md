# Welcome to BleMD.
this project was for goal to import nintendo GC/Wii ".bmd" 3D models,
using blender (blender.org)

## HOW TO USE: *this section was too long, and moved to MANUAL.md*

## project structure, and advice for anyone willing to tinker with the code: see dev_notes.md

## HISTORY:
The history of this plugin is long, and incredibly hard to trace.

It started with BMD Viewer and BMDview2, from YAZ0 (just where is this person's home page?), in C++

it has a copy on the google code server (http://code.google.com/p/bmdview2/)

Originally it came from this discussion thread:
http://www.emutalk.net/threads/54262-BMDView2-Linux?p=447701

And that had this download link:

An older Readme.txt file that was found from a file BMDview2.rar said:
```
latest version of BMD View 2 at

The official emutalk thread for this program can be found at

Oh, and it is here (http://www.vg-resource.com/thread-21121.html) too.

then, because the exportation was really lossy, MaxBMD, a MaxScript variation that used 3dsMax from Autodesk, was created.
It was based on bmdview2pre3 by thakis (homepage at http://amnoid.de/gc/ download source at http://www.emutalk.net/showthread.php?t=26919&page=39)
it still had a lot of bugs, and a LOT of different branches. Plus 3dsMax is expensive, And (from my perspective) maxscript is hard to debug due to the need to reboot 3dsMax (a several-minutes process) after each modification.
the discussion where it originaly(?) appeared is here: http://www.emutalk.net/threads/44490

It was then adapted by Niacdoial (me) from Avatarus-One's version on Github(https://github.com/Avatarus-one/MaxBMD/)
and a bit of the latest BMDView2 program (and planning to use more of it for better materials)
to use blender instead (plus, it is a python plug-in, so that language is far easier to debug, and robust IDEs exist)

Finally, the current verion (BleMD) is part of a no-admin-needed pipeline (if you have the right C++ libraries (most PCs do))
